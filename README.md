# VirtualCare

THE PROBLEM

In these hard pandemic times, the hospitals have been getting extremely overcrowded, creating chaos both for the patients and the medical staff. The conditions right now in hospitals are absolutely horrendous, causing major problems for everyone involved.


OUR SOLUTION

We have created VirtualCare, an e-Health application designed to connect patients to specialized medical professionals to get a quick diagnosis or prescription medication. At the same time, we are helping our customers save, on average, about 4.3 hours of time. Time that they would have spent driving to the hospital, waiting there for a doctor to see them and then driving all the way back home. More people getting their treatments online means less people actually going to the hospital for non-urgent matters, this in turn improving the overall general conditions in crowded hospitals.


Setup:

1. Create a virtual environment:

```
    virtualenv venv
```
2. Set .env from .env.template


```
PSQL_DB_NAME – The name of the database to be filled.
PSQL_USER_NAME – The database username.
PSQL_HOST – localhost
PSQL_PASSWORD – The database user password.
```

3. Create database: 

```
Run sql file:

    data/data.sql

Into the database.
```
